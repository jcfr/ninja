Generating the docs:
  sudo apt-get install asciidoc --no-install-recommends
  ./ninja doc

Adjusting build flags:
  It's kind of a hack, but edit config.ninja (which was generated by
  bootstrap.sh) to turn on debugging symbols.

Test-driven development:
  Set your build command to
    ./ninja ninja_test && ./ninja_test --gtest_filter=MyTest.Name
  now you can repeatedly run that while developing until the tests pass.
  Remember to build "all" before committing to verify the other source
  still works!

Coding guidelines:
- Function name are camelcase.
- Member methods are camelcase, expect for trivial getters which are
  underscore separated.
- Local variables are underscore separated.
- Member variables are underscore separated and suffixed by an extra underscore.
- Two spaces indentation.
- Opening braces is at the end of line.
- Lines are 80 columns maximum.
- All source files should have the Google Inc. license header.
- Also follow this style:
  http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

Documentation guidelines:
- Use /// for doxygen.
- Use \a to refer to arguments.
- It's not necessary to document each argument, especially when they're
  relatively self-evident (e.g. in CanonicalizePath(string* path, string* err),
  the arguments are hopefully obvious)
